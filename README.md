# Autoencoder Comparison for Image Processing and Reconstruction

## Description
This project aims to compare the performance of five different autoencoder architectures in the task of image processing and reconstruction using the MNIST and MNIST Fashion datasets. Autoencoders are neural network models trained to encode input data into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decode it back to reconstruct the original input. The goal of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of different autoencoder architectures in accurately reconstructing images and preserving essential features.

## Features
- Implementation of five different autoencoder architectures - [Vanilla, Convolutional, Variational, Denoising, Sparse]
- Training and evaluation of autoencoders using the MNIST and MNIST Fashion datasets.
- Comparison of reconstruction quality and performance metrics between different autoencoder architectures.
- Visualization of reconstructed images and latent space representations.
- Evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of each autoencoder architecture for image processing tasks.

## Technologies
- Jupyter Notebook: for interactive development and documentation.
- Python: programming language for implementing and training autoencoder models.
- TensorFlow and Keras: deep learning frameworks for building and training neural networks.
- MNIST and MNIST Fashion datasets: standard datasets for handwritten digits and fashion items.
- Matplotlib or Seaborn: for visualization of images, performance metrics, and latent space representations.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to provide insights into the performance of different autoencoder architectures for image processing and reconstruction tasks. By comparing the reconstruction quality and evaluating various metrics, such as mean squared error or structural similarity index, we aim to identify which autoencoder architecture performs best for the given datasets. This information can help  practitioners choose the most suitable autoencoder architecture for specific image processing applications.
